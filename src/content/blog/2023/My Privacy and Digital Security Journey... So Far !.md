In today's digital age, protecting our personal information and digital security is more important than ever. As we rely more and more on technology for our daily tasks and communication, it's crucial to take steps to safeguard our information from potential threats. In this post, I'll be sharing my journey towards improving my privacy and digital security and the various components that I've incorporated.

First, let's start with the hardware components. The devices we use on a daily basis such as our phones and computers are the foundation of our digital lives. I use an iPhone with iOS as my primary phone, and I have turned off all the iCloud functions except Find My. If I would still be using iCloud features, I would recommend turning on Advanced Data Protection (which is the new end-to-end encrypted feature for some iCloud services), unfortunately it is not yet available in my region The more I dive deep into privacy, the more I want to move to a Google Pixel with GrapheneOS, as it is a more secure and open-source option. GrapheneOS is built on top of the Android Open Source Project, with additional privacy and security features such as the ability to run apps in a sandboxed environment, and the ability to easily and quickly wipe the device of all personal data.

My computer is a Mac at the moment, but in the future, I am looking for something Linux-based like Pop!_OS and a System76 laptop, as Linux is known for its security features and open-source nature. Linux-based operating systems, in general, are considered more secure than Windows or macOS, as they are less susceptible to malware and viruses, and they are more customizable to the user's needs.

Next, let's talk about browsers and search engines. The browser is the gateway to the internet, and it's essential to use a secure browser that encrypts your data and blocks potential threats. I use Brave as my main browser, mainly for websites where I need to log in, with Brave Search as my search engine. Brave is built on top of the Chromium open-source project, and it blocks third-party cookies and ads by default, and it also has a feature called Tor which allows you to browse the internet anonymously, I personally do not use it within the Brave browser, if necessary I would use the Tor application but very rarely require it, for people wiht different threat models that might be of interest to you. I also use Firefox with hardened settings for added security, I use that for random searches.

In terms of email, I use ProtonMail, which offers end-to-end encryption for added security. 
I have 2 of my domains connected to ProtonMail and have completely abandoned the Google Suite. For messaging, I use Signal, which also offers end-to-end encryption. Signal is considered one of the most secure messaging apps out there, this is because it uses the open-source Signal Protocol for end-to-end encryption, which has been independently audited and is considered to be very secure. I still keep WhatsApp since many people still use it, but if possible I would try to switch to Signal completely.

In terms of VPN, I use ProtonVPN, which offers a high level of security and privacy. ProtonVPN is a zero-log VPN, this means that they do not track or store any information about your browsing habits. I have it on constantly on my computer and phone when connected to WiFi, I don't see the use of having it on my phone when using cellular data, but either way if I'm connecting to public Wi-Fi at airports, hotels etc... I would absolutely have it on.

For my password manager, I use Bitwarden and is the one I would recommend for most people.
I used LastPass previously (given the recent events I would not recommend it), but switched a while back to Bitwarden as it's open-source and much cheaper, for most people the free option is more than enough, but having ordered a security key the subscription is necessary (only $10 per year), and you can also self-host it. For people with higher threat models/or that want to keep the passwords completely offline (no sync to multiple devices unless you do it some other way) I would recommendKeePassXC.

For my 2FA app I use Raivo currently, but I have a YubiKey on order, so I will be implementing that as soon as it arrives. YubiKey is a small hardware device that you can use as an additional form of authentication, it is considered to be more secure than using SMS or an authenticator app.

For storage, I have been using Proton Drive, which is an encrypted cloud storage service offered by ProtonMail. I also use encrypted USB drives with VeraCrypt for some backups, and I am looking to build my own home server soon, maybe with Nextcloud to sync pictures and other files. This way, I would have control over my data and where it is stored, and I can ensure that it is properly encrypted and secure.

In terms of other FOSS (Free and Open-Source Software) apps, I use Standard Notes for my encrypted note-taking, Obsidian (not encrypted, and I sync it using GitHub) for working on other projects such as these blog posts, Proton Calendar as my calendar of choice, Pocket Casts for listening to podcasts without needing to make an account, and Vienna as my Mac RSS feed reader.

In conclusion, my privacy and digital security journey has been a process of continually researching and implementing new tools and techniques. It is important to note that there is no such thing as a fail-proof system when it comes to digital security, but by taking a step-by-step approach and constantly updating and improving our security measures, we can greatly reduce the risk of our personal information being compromised. By using secure hardware and operating systems, secure browsers and search engines, encrypted email and messaging, a VPN, a password manager and 2FA, and utilizing FOSS apps, we can take control of our digital lives and protect ourselves from potential threats.

It's important to remember that this is a journey, and not a destination. As technology and threats evolve, so should our security measures. Staying informed about new developments and staying vigilant is the key to maintaining a high level of digital security. The most important thing is to make sure that your security is better than the average person, as it's not always possible to protect against every threat, but by making it more difficult for attackers to access your information, you reduce the risk of being a target.

In summary, my privacy and digital security journey has been an ongoing process, but by taking a step-by-step approach and constantly researching and implementing new tools and techniques, I am able to take control of my digital life and protect myself from potential threats.

## Resources 

In addition to the steps and tools I have discussed in this blog post, there are also a number of resources available for those who are interested in learning more about privacy and digital security.

One such resource is "Why Privacy Matters" by Glenn Greenwald. This article/video provides a comprehensive overview of the importance of privacy in today's digital age and the various ways in which our personal information is being collected and used without our knowledge or consent.

Another great resource is "Extreme Privacy" by Michael Bazzell. This book provides a detailed and practical guide to protecting your personal information and maintaining your privacy in the digital age. It covers various topics such as encryption, VPNs, password managers, and more.

For those who are interested in learning more about the impact of surveillance on privacy, the Snowden documents and the movie "Citizenfour" offer a deep dive into the inner workings of government surveillance programs and their impact on individual privacy. As well as the "Snowden" film by Oliver Stone.

"Beginner's Introduction to Privacy" by Naomi Brockwell is a great resource for those who are new to the topic and want to learn more about privacy in the digital age and how to get started.

"The Art of Invisibility" by Kevin Mitnick is a great resource for those who want to learn more about the techniques and tools used by experts to maintain their privacy and security in the digital age.

"Privacy, Security & OSINT" podcast with Michael Bazzell is a great resource for those $ho are interested in learning more about the intersection of privacy, security, and OSINT (Open-Source Intelligence). It's one of my favorite podcasts at the moment.
